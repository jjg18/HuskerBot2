- Spring Data JPA with H2 (file-backed) datastore
- Gradle build

## Requirements
- Java 17 or newer
- Discord bot token with appropriate permissions
- (Optional) API keys for external services (e.g., CollegeFootballData)

## Configuration
Edit `src/main/resources/application.yml`:
- `discord.token`: Your bot token
- `discord.guilds`: Guild IDs where the bot should operate
- Channels and category IDs as needed
- `cfbd.api-key`: CollegeFootballData API key if you use lines/matchup features
- Weather and Urban Dictionary settings are already configured with sensible defaults

## Run Locally
1. Set your configuration in `application.yml`.
2. Build and run using the Gradle wrapper:
   - macOS/Linux: `./gradlew bootRun`
   - Windows: `gradlew.bat bootRun`

To build a jar:
- macOS/Linux: `./gradlew build`
- Windows: `gradlew.bat build`

## Testing
- Unit tests: `./gradlew test`
- Additional testing scripts live under the `testing/` directory (Python and shell helpers for weather parsing).
